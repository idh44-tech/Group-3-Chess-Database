# Introduction

The system is a chess tracker service that exists on a webpage.  It provides useful functions like the ability to create, catalogue, and track profiles of individual players.  It also provides useful rescources such as a page containing information on various openings.  It is mainly targeted towards players who play primarily offline, as it provides many of the services and statistics tracked by online applications.  Our value proposition is that it will allow you to easily and quickly track and manage information about chess players you would otherwise not know or have to write down.  The MVP will implement a feature to create, view, and update player profiles with their elo rating and name.  It will also provide a way to search through these profile and view a leaderboard.

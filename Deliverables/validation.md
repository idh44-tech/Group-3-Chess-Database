# Description

Our system is a chess player database in the form of a website which allows the user to upload, modify, and remove user profiles with information such as name and elo rating.  The system is targeted towards chess players, mostly those who play offline and wish to track theirs and others statistics for chess.  The system would cut down on time and energy spent remembering or recording player information while also giving accurate, easily available information on the site.  The MVP includes the ability to add, modify, and delete user profiles, as well as search through them and view a leaderboard.

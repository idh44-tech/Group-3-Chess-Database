**Introduction**

Our system is a chess tracker which provides various features useful to chess players.

It will include features such as uploading profiles of players with various metrics about them including elo, winrates, and common openings they play.  It will also allow users to update player information to reflect changes in their skill and playstyle over time.  It will also include other miscellaneous features such as a page on common openings and a timer feature.

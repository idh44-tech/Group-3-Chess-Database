# Introduction

Our system is a chess tracker which provides various features useful to chess players.  The site will cut down on the time and effort required to memorize or record information pertinent for chess players.  It will include features such as uploading profiles of players with various metrics about them including elo, winrates, and common openings they play.  It will also allow users to update player information to reflect changes in their skill and playstyle over time.  It will also include other miscellaneous features such as a page on common openings and a timer feature.

1.1 No implementation performed (not directly, did a little code that was handed off to other group members).  Did all the work outside of implementation for every deliverable.

**Automated Testing**

Our testing framework is Jest.  We chose this framework because group members were already familiar with it.  
Link to the test file [here](https://github.com/idh44-tech/Group-3-Chess-Database/blob/main/script.test.js) 
Link to the file being tested [here](https://github.com/idh44-tech/Group-3-Chess-Database/blob/main/script.js) 
The test validates that the site responds correctly to various kinds of input for entering a new profile in.  
I wasn't able to test it myself.  I'm on windows and can't get node.js to work in cmd.  

# Technology Stack

Javascript: It handles most of the code and logic of our site.  Chosen as it is the go-to programming language for web development.

html: Used for the text in our site, html is the best and simplest option for formatting text.

Jest: For unit testing our javascript code.  Group members were most familiar with this unit testing framework for javascript.

# Learning Strategy

Through a combination of online tutorials and articles relevant to the technologies utilized.  Communication on the team is done primarily through discord text chat.  Group members did not document time spent learning new technologies, but it's usually a few hours at most.  Communication was occasionally an issue, but someone was always willing to step up and solve the problem.  

# Deployment

site link [here](https://math1029.github.io/Group-3-Chess-Database/)
Deployed via github itself this is the easiest way, at least for now, while development is still underway.  

# Licensing

We adopted the MIT license because the software is fundamentally quite simple compared to other software projects and we see no issue with allowing it to be freely shared and redistributed.

# Repository Documentation

All files are [here](https://github.com/idh44-tech/Group-3-Chess-Database)  

# User Interface Design

The site had a simple and intuitive design that is easy to understand.

The site allows you to add profiles as a user, documenting player information.

We also have our openings page, which contains information on many common chess openings

# Retrospective Analysis

We were very uncoordinated with how we worked.  The work still got done, but it was in an uncertain and unorganized fashion.  For future releases, we are going to be clearer on roles and tasks that need to be done to ensure the work gets done efficiently.
